<h2>The database management system</h2>
The database management system (DBMS) acts as an interface between the databases
And its users, isolating users from the details of the database structure,
This research was conducted while the authors were on the faculty of the Department of Management
Information Systems at the University of Arizona .Partially supported by NSF MCS-77-
24234 (M.E. S. Loomis), the NATO Research Scholarship obtained through the German Academy
Exchange service (W. Effelsberg).

Even a seemingly simple CODASYL DML phrase can involve traversal
Many event logs and sometimes complex access analysis
Paths. These activities remain transparent to the database end user.
However, dealing with these functions with the database management system contributes greatly
To the level of performance the database user perceives (and pays for).
In this work, we explore one aspect of database system performance:
Database reference patterns and implications for DBMS performance Understanding reference patterns is essential to design
Many of the DBMS components (for example, buffer management policies and query optimization)
Methods, indexing techniques, etc.) These components must be designed with
Minimize physical disk access in mind for improvement
DBMS overall performance
Historically, there has been widespread interest in program reference behavior.
These efforts have given working group concepts and principle
, Which later became the basis for page development Management policies, for example, replacing the most recently used less page (LRU),
Which generally reduces software migration requirements in virtual memory operating systems .We suggest that an understanding of database reference behavior is possible
Likewise leads to improved database buffer management strategies, and hence at
Improved DBMS performance
All the databases we analyzed were supported by CODASYL

Relational systems management was discussed in a paper by Sacco

Also, differences are found between page reference styles
