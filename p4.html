<h2>A THREE-LEVEL MODEL OF DATABASE TRAVERSAL:</h2>
We represent DBMS as a multi-layered system with three levels: Logical or DML
Level, internal level, and physical level
Similar approaches have been taken
Proposed in the literature; While the other authors focus
On the specific objects and processes in each level, we emphasize dynamics
Part of passing data
During query execution, DBMS accesses
Various data objects from the database; The way you access current data
An object from the previous is called the traversal type.
Since we are primarily concerned with CODASYL databases, the first level is
CODASYL DML level or logical level
The objects selected at this level are
Records and groups, as defined in the CODASYL schema
At this level, we distinguish
Three types of traversal:<br>
(1)	NEXT or PRIOR-corresponds to the DML function FIND NEXT record
(WITHIN set);<br>
(2)	UP/DOWN-corresponds to the DML functions FIND FIRST member
WITHIN set, FIND LAST member WITHIN set, or FIND OWNER
WITHIN set; and<br>
(3)	DIRECT-which results from the execution of a FIND function that does<br>







Our second level is inner night. Data objects at this level are records
Occurrence in its internal representation .Types of traversal inside
The level corresponds to the four methods of accessing an internal record in a database:<br>
(1) POINTER - Uses a pointer stored in one record to access another record
Within a group
Examples of indicators are the following, previous, and owner indicators;<br>
(2) INDEXED uses an index (for example, Tree B) to find the occurrence of the next record.<br>
The index can be defined for a record type or for a group.
(3) Express the stored records through their physical communication. An<br>
An example is a survey over an area; And
(4) CALCIDBKEY - Includes all types of internal traversal, including use
CALC, database, and currency indicators (currency indicators)
It is usually stored in DBMS as Database Key Values).
 
The internal layout (or storage scheme) determines the designation between
Logical and internal level, usually designed
By the database administrator, he has options for setting settings and adjusting indicators
Records, indicators and so on
Certain traversal can be set at the logical DML level
For a variety of types of traversal internally
For example, NEXT
DML passing can be a transition point, an indicator, or a sequential transition at an internal level, depending on the tuning mode chosen by
Database administrator
Likewise, direct traversal with a user-defined key
At the DML level, it can be either INDEXED traversal or CALC / DBKEY
Domestically, depending on the access path for the key chosen by
Database administrator
The third level is physical zeol. Data objects at this level are the database
Pages. In this paper, it is assumed that the database consists of pages
Equal size and every page has a unique page number. Types of traversal on
The physical level characterizes DBMS page reference behavior:<br>
(1) Site - Unofficially, the region means that the pages that were recently referenced
Reference probability higher than other pages If a local is present in
Physical level, replacement strategies of virtual memory operating systems
It can be used in the DBMS buffer, because it is designed for very local use
Addressing software behavior
Examples of such strategies are LRU<br>
(2) suffix - move from page with page number i to page
With the page number i + l called serial pass. If there is a sequence
On the physical level,<br>
(3) RANDOM ACCESS - All other page accesses are called random access.
The mapping between internal and physical levels depends on the data<br>
Assembly within the database
Unfortunately, this aspect is not very good
Understood in most CODASYL databases
The properties of the actual mass are affected by many factors;
Update database history. Examples of internal schema options are groups of DBA defined groups (DBMS) are attempting to place group members
Owner page (or subsequent pages), fragmentation area sizes, and initial load factors
For pages An example of how update history affects specific groups
The sequence of uploading member records to a group; If uploaded in the specified order,
Many DBMSs will group it on successive pages. One of the reasons maps are between interior and physical levels
Hard to understand is the potential inconsistency of options in the internal layout.
An example of this is a member record type with two different types of owner records in
Two groups (V structure), where only member records can be grouped to one group
Groups Also, the fact that the update history is included makes it very difficult
To use a specific internal scheme to predict the actual mass properties of
CODASYL database
